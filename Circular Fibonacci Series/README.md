# Circular Fibonacci Series Project

## Overview

This C program generates the Fibonacci series up to a specified position and stores the values in a circular linked list.<br>
It uses a stack to maintain the correct order of the series before transferring it to the circular list.

## Features

- **Generates Fibonacci Series:** Calculates Fibonacci numbers up to a given position.
- **Uses Circular Linked List:** Stores the Fibonacci numbers in a circular linked list.
- **Maintains Order with Stack:** Uses a stack to ensure numbers are inserted into the circular list in descending order.
- **File Output:** Prints the series to the screen and saves it to a user-specified file.
